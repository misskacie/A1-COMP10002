The goal of this assignment was to create a calculator with an arbitrary max number of digits to be stored without using dynamic programming. I implemented addition, subtraction, multiplication and division algorithms to perform operations on the type defintion of a number which was stored as 
a struct containing an integer describing stored digits and a fixed length integer array for the number. Care was taken to ensure edge cases were handled appropriately.
