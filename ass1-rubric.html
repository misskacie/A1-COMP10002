<li>Stage 3 initial allocation, +1.
</ul>

<p><i>Deductions</i>
</p>

<li>lines &gt;80 chars, -0.5;
<li>other stylistic issue (minor), -0.5;
<li>other stylistic issue (major), -1.0;
</ul>

<p>Marks in each section won't go below zero.
</p>

<p><i>Bonus additions (included in total mark only if there were
marks deducted within this first section)</i>
</p>

<ul>
<li>comment at end that says "algorithms are fun", +0.5;
<li>overall care and presentation, +0.5;
</ul>

<h4>Section B: Structure and Approach</h4>

<p>Including: decomposition in to functions, development of data
structures and declaration of them at the appropriate locations,
choice of parameters to functions,
<!--use of appropriate <tt>struct</tt> and
<tt>typedef</tt> declarations, choice of algorithms or methods,
-->
overall flow and high-level readability.
</p>

<p><i>Additions</i>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Stage 1 initial allocation, +4.
<li>Stage 2 initial allocation, +1.
<li>Stage 3 initial allocation, +1.
</ul>

<p><i>Deductions</i>
</p>

<ul>
<li>duplicate code segments, -0.5;
<li>global variables, -0.5;
<li>main program too long or too complex, -0.5;

END-CHOICES -->
</ul>

<p>Marks in each section won't go below zero.
</p>

<h4>Section C: Program Execution</h4>

<p>Including: compilation, execution on test data, output presentation
and readability.
Programs that do not compile in the test environment will lose all
marks in this section.
Be sure to check the GradeScope execution output
before you say "finished" to yourself.
</p>

<p><i>Additions</i>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Stage 1 initial allocation, +2.
<li>Stage 2 initial allocation, +2.
<li>Stage 3 initial allocation, +2.
</ul>

</p>

<ul>
<li>failure to compile, -6.0;
<li>unnecessary warning messages in compilation, -2.0;
<li>incorrect Stage 1 layout or values error in any test, -0.5;
<li>different Stage 1 layout or values error in any test, -0.5;
<li>incorrect Stage 2 layout or values error in any test, -0.5;
<li>different Stage 2 layout or values error in any test, -0.5;
<li>incorrect Stage 3a layout or values error in any test, -0.5;
<li>different Stage 3a layout or values error in any test, -0.5;
<li>incorrect Stage 3b layout or values error in any test, -0.5;
<li>different Stage 3b layout or values error in any test, -0.5;
</ul>

<p>Marks in each section won't go below zero.
</p>


<h4>Section D: Late Penalty</h4>

<p>If you make a late submission without having prior agreement from
Alistair, a late penalty will be applied.
Overall marks won't go below zero.
No assignments -- with or without late penalty -- will be accepted
more than seven days after the assignment deadline.
</p>

<ul>
<li>one day late, -2.0;
<li>two days late, -4.0;
<li>three days late, -6.0;

Overall marks won't go below zero.
</p>

<li>significant overlap detected with another submission, -10.0;
<li>use of external code without attribution (minor), -2.0;
<li>use of external code without attribution (major), -10.0;
</ul>
